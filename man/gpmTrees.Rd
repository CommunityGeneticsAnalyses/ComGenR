\title{
Foundation tree species genotype-phenotype mapping function for cgSim. 
}
\description{
  Generates a matrix of genotypic and phenotypic values using the
  methods of Shuster et al. 2006 to be used in the cgSim function.
}
\usage{
gpmTrees(pheno = "phenotype of genotypes", reps = "replication")
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{pheno}{
    A vector of phenotypic values for a set of genotypes. 
}
  \item{reps}{
    Scalar to set the number of replicates for the genotypes.
  }
}
\details{
  This function populates a matrix to be used as the foundation tree
  species that is influencing a set of species in a community in the
  cgSim function.
